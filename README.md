Written by Danny Richardson for [Pixel Primate](http://www.pixelprimate.com)


## Installation
==

Copy the files over to `/site/addons/SafeGlide`.


## Usage
==

Instead of using `{{ glide:id }}` use  `{{ SafeGlide:id }}`. I have no idea if this works with the tag pair syntax, it probably doesn't.

There are additional options in the CP under addons â€“ it's worth checking these out and saving to create a settings YAML file before first use.
